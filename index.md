I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics (Aix-Marseille University). My research focuses on how place-based and industrial policies affect labor market outcomes, firm behavior, and intra-household dynamics. A complementary line of research explores how international trade drives technology adoption.


        </p>

My main research interests are Development, Spatial, and Labor Economics.

In Spring 2025, I will be visiting the Department of Economics at University College London, hosted by Professor Gabriel Ulyssea. During this period, I will also be a visiting scholar at the Center for Tax Analysis in Developing Countries (TaxDev) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
