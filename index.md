        I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics (Aix-Marseille University). My research focuses on how place-based and industrial policies affect workers, households, and firms, with a particular emphasis on labor market outcomes, unpaid work, and technology adoption. My work lies at the intersection of spatial, labor, and development economics. Another part of my recent work examines technology adoption driven by trade.

In Spring 2025, I will be visiting the Department of Economics at University College London, hosted by Professor Gabriel Ulyssea. During this period, I will also be a visiting scholar at the Center for Tax Analysis in Developing Countries (TaxDev) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
