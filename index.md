I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics (Aix-Marseille University). 
</p>

My main research interests lie in the fields of Development Economics, Labor Economics, and International Trade. I study how place-based policies, trade, and technology interact with firm heterogeneity to shape labor markets, informality, and household well-being in developing economies.

My main research interests are Development, Spatial, and Labor Economics.

- I am a Visiting PhD Fellow at the World Institute for Development Economics Research, United Nations University (UNU-WIDER), in Helsinki, Finland. I would love to connect if youâ€™re in the area!
- In Spring 2025, I visited the Department of Economics at University College London, hosted by Professor Gabriel Ulyssea, and at the Center for Tax Analysis in Developing Countries (TaxDev) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
