        I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics (Aix-Marseille University), under the supervision of Lorenzo Rotunno and Federico Trionfetti. 
        My research focuses on how place-based policies affect workers, households, and firms, with a particular emphasis on labor market outcomes, unpaid work, and 
        technology adoption. My work lies at the intersection of spatial economics, labor, and development, especially in the context of developing countries. 
        Another part of my recent work examines technology adoption driven by trade.
