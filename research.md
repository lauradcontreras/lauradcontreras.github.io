## Working papers
- Informality and Place-Based Policies\
  *Aggregate and individual effects of PBPs on the informal sector*
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary> <p> 
This paper studies the local economic impact of the Free Economic Zones (FEZs) program established in Colombia between 2005-2018. Based on a novel data set that combines georeferenced data on FEZs, municipalities, and household characteristics, I measure the spatial effects of the creation of these zones on labor market outcomes, focusing on informality. Results show that establishing FEZs significantly increases informality, with positive spillovers to nearby regions and a decrease in distance. To rationalize these findings, I develop a spatial structural model with informality, international trade, and firm sorting.  </p></details>
