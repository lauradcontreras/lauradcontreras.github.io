- The Unintended Consequences of Industrial Policies: Evidence from Colombia\
  *Aggregate and individual effects of PBPs on the informal sector*
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary> <p> 
This paper examines the local and aggregate economic impact of Colombia’s Free Economic Zones (FEZs) program, implemented between 2005 and 2018. Using a novel dataset that integrates georeferenced data on Free Economic Zones (FEZs), municipalities, household characteristics, and firms, I analyze the spatial effects of these zones on labor markets and firm dynamics, with a particular focus on informality. The findings reveal that FEZs significantly increase informality but have a minimal impact on overall employment. Empirically, I show that FEZs boost the profitability of high-productivity formal firms, enabling them to raise wages and expand employment. However, this also raises labor costs, forcing low-productivity formal firms to exit and increasing the productivity threshold for formal firm entry, ultimately leading to higher informality. Building on these results, I develop a structural model to quantify the aggregate effects of this place-based policy. </p></details>
